# FilesLink FAQ

## How do I get my Telegram channel ID?
- Forward any message from your channel to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) and copy the ID (starts with `-100`).

## Why do files disappear after redeploy?
- Free hosting does not provide persistent disk. Files are stored in Telegram, not locally.

## Can I host for free?
- Yes! Use Railway, Fly.io, or Render (see README for details).

## How do I update permissions?
- Use the CLI tool or restart the bot.
