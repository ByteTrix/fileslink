### üê≥ **Run Using Docker Engine**

**Files uploaded via the bot are stored in the `/app/files` directory within the Docker container.** The `volumes`
section
in the `docker-compose.yml` file maps this directory to `/path/to/store/files` on your host machine. This means you can
access the files through `/path/to/store/files` on your host machine. Also, permissions file location is
a `/app/config/permissions.json`.

You can easily run **FilesLink** using Docker. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kvnxo/fileslink.git
   cd fileslink
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**

   Run the Docker container with the environment variables:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the Application**

   **FilesLink** will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### üöÄ **Run Locally**

For running locally or testing, you can run **FilesLink** without Docker Compose. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Rust**

   Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your machine. You can install it from
   the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Run Telegram Bot API**

   Before running the bot, you need to run the Telegram Bot API server. You can run it locally or use the official API.
   For launch the API server locally, you need to configure `.env` file and run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f dockerc-compose-telegram-api.yml up -d
    ```

   **Note:** The API server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8088`.

   **Note:** If you want to use the official API, you don't need to run the API server locally and don't need to
   set `TELEGRAM_API_URL` environment variable.

3. **Build and Run the Application**

   Build and run the application using `cargo` commands:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

    - By default, the bot will listen on `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Access the Application**

    - **FilesLink** will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` for local development.

**Note:** For local testing, the `./files` directory will be relative to project‚Äôs root directory.

**Note:** Permissions file location is a `./config/permissions.json`.

### üîß **CLI**

Cli is used to manage permissions. You can use the following commands:

- **`update-permissions`**: Update permissions from the configuration file.

Usage:

```bash
3. **Use CLI Options:**

   ```bash
   ./fileslink-cli [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
   ```
```

Docker usage:

```bash
docker exec -it fileslink-app fileslink-cli [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
```

Options:

* **`--path`** - Path to the FIFO.

  default: `/tmp/fileslink.pipe`

  env: FILESLINK_PIPE_PATH

  **Note:** The path should be the same as in the bot configuration.

Subcommands:

* **`update-permissions`** - Updates the permissions from the config file.
* **`shutdown`** - Shutting down the system.
* **`help`** - Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s).

Update permissions:

```bash
Example:

```bash
./fileslink-cli --path /path/to/fifo.pipe update-permissions
```
```

Docker update permissions:

```bash
docker exec -it fileslink-app fileslink-cli update-permissions
```

**Note:** Docker container default path is `/app/fileslink.pipe`.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Permissions**

Permissions in the application are managed through a JSON configuration file that sets access rules for all users or
specific users regarding different chats.

Permissions updates every restart or by using the CLI command `update-permissions`

#### üîß **Configuration File Format**

The configuration file located at `config/permissions.json` and use the following format:

```json
{
  "allow_all": [
    "STRING_OR_LIST"
  ],
  "chats": {
    "CHAT1_ID": [
      "STRING_OR_LIST"
    ],
    "CHAT2_ID": "USER1_ID, USER2_ID",
    "CHAT3_ID": 1234567,
    "CHAT4_ID": "*"
  }
}
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration File Fields**

##### Possible values for the chat configuration are:

- **`STRING`**: A list of IDs separated by commas - **","** (spaces are allowed) or **"*"** for all users.

  examples:
  ```json
  {
    "field1": "1234567, 2345678",
    "field2": "*"
  }
  ```

- **`NUMBER`**: A single user ID.

  example
  ```json
  {
    "field1": 1234567
  }
  ```

- **`LIST`**: A list of user IDs that have access to the chat. Allowed combination of strings and numbers.

  example

  ```json
  {
    "field1": [1234567, 2345678],
    "field2": ["1234567", "2345678"],
    "field3": [1234567, "2345678"]
  }
  ```

##### Configuration Fields:

- **`allow_all`**: Defines access rules for all users.
- **`chats`**: A dictionary where the key is the chat ID and the value is the chat configuration.

  example
  ```json
  {
    "allow_all": "*",
    "chats": {
      "chat1": "*",
      "chat2": [1234567, 2345678]
    }
  }
  ```

#### üîë **Configuration Examples**

##### 1. **Grant Access to All Users for All Chats**

```json
{
  "allow_all": "*",
  "chats": {}
}
```

In this example, **all users** have access to all chats because `allow_all` is set to `"*"`.

##### 2. **Grant Access to Only Specific Users for All Chats**

```json 
{
  "allow_all": [
    "1234567",
    "2345678"
  ],
  "chats": {}
}
```

This example grants access to **all chats** only to `1234567` and `2345678`.

##### 3. **Grant Access to All Users for General Chats and Set Special Permissions for Specific Chats**

```json
{
  "allow_all": 4567890,
  "chats": {
    "chat1": [
      "1234567",
      2345678
    ],
    "chat2": "*"
  }
}
```

In this example:

- **User `4567890`** have access to all chats due to `allow_all` being `"4567890"` for general access.
- **For `chat1`**, access is granted only to `1234567` and `2345678`.
- **For `chat2`**, access is granted to all users (just like the other chats).

##### 4. **Restrict Access for All Users and Set Special Permissions**

```json
{
  "allow_all": "31235425",
  "chats": {
    "chat3": [
      "43243243"
    ]
  }
}
```

In this example:

- **Only `31235425`** has access to all chats.
- **Only `43243243`** has access to `chat3`.
